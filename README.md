# Chicken-letter-outer
This is a constantly (and intermittently) evolving project wherein I use an amazon alexa device along with a HUZZAHESP8266 Feather board from Adafruit to create a simple voice controlled chicken coop door opener. 

I've tried several libraries to get the HUZZAHESP8266 board and Alexa to work together, most of the time I had trouble getting Alexa to recognize the device. I'm currently using the [Sinric](https://github.com/kakopappa/sinric) library. It's working well so far. Another alternative I'm considering is [aRest](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/aREST). At present, Alexa can detect and activate/deactivate the relay. I'm currently searching for a suitable motor and other components.
